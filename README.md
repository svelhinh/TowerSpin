## Why choose Tower Color ?
I had ideas for both games but I found the gameplay of Tower Color funnier and, given the time I had to develop the game, the additional time for designing the levels for the Split Balls 3D made me choose Tower Color. I prefered to do a solid and playable game that meets the deadline than a game with fancy levels.

## What is my extra Gameplay feature ?
My extra gameplay feature is based on blocks only destroyed by super balls. Super balls can be obtained if player hits 5 times blocks matching current ball color.
I also added another extra feature to match the first extra gameplay feature goal, this feature is that the tower rotates itself and accelerate with level progression.
This feature has for purpose to increase the strategic aspect of the original game. The player has to be more focus to aim right color blocks.
